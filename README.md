# To Do App

This is a react based To Do App which is actually functional. It uses your browser's local storage to store the todos, so the data is completely private and secure limited to your device only.

This project uses ReactTransitionGroup for transition effects.

1. Adding Meeting Details such as time, location and notes.
2. Adding Push Notifications to alert the time of an appointment
